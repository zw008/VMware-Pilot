Multi-step workflow orchestration for VMware MCP skills — state machine, approval gates, audit trail.

> **Companion skills** handle everything else:
>
> | Skill | Scope | Install |
> |-------|-------|---------|
> | **[vmware-aiops](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AIops)** | VM lifecycle, deployment, guest ops, cluster | `uv tool install vmware-aiops` |
> | **[vmware-monitor](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Monitor)** | Read-only: inventory, health, alarms, events | `uv tool install vmware-monitor` |
> | **[vmware-storage](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Storage)** | Datastores, iSCSI, vSAN management | `uv tool install vmware-storage` |
> | **[vmware-vks](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-VKS)** | Tanzu Namespaces, TKC cluster lifecycle | `uv tool install vmware-vks` |
> | **[vmware-nsx](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-NSX)** | NSX networking: segments, gateways, NAT | `uv tool install vmware-nsx-mgmt` |
> | **[vmware-nsx-security](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-NSX-Security)** | DFW firewall rules, security groups | `uv tool install vmware-nsx-security` |
> | **[vmware-aria](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-Aria)** | Aria Ops: metrics, alerts, capacity | `uv tool install vmware-aria` |
> | **[vmware-avi](https://github.com/zw008/VMware-AVI)** | AVI load balancing, pool management, AKO K8s ops | `uv tool install vmware-avi` |

## Install

```bash
uv tool install vmware-pilot
vmware-pilot mcp          # start the MCP server (stdio)
```

### Offline / Air-Gapped Install (from source)

This project uses the modern PEP 517 build system (hatchling), so there is **no
`setup.py`** by design — that is expected, not a missing file. If you cloned the
source and hit `ERROR: File "setup.py" or "setup.cfg" not found ... editable mode
currently requires a setuptools-based build`, your `pip` is older than 21.3 and
cannot do an *editable* (`-e`) install with a non-setuptools backend. Editable
mode is a developer convenience, not needed to run the tool — do one of:

```bash
# From the source tree — a normal (non-editable) install builds a wheel:
pip install .              # NOT  pip install -e .

# ...or upgrade pip first, and editable works too:
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -e .
```

For a **truly air-gapped host**, build the wheels on a connected machine and copy
them over — the target then needs no network:

```bash
# On a connected machine, collect this package + its dependencies as wheels:
pip wheel . -w dist        # → dist/*.whl   (or: uv build, for just this package)

# Copy dist/ to the air-gapped host, then install offline:
pip install --no-index --find-links dist vmware-pilot
```

## MCP Tools (13 — 4 read, 9 write)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_skill_catalog` | List all available skills and tools for workflow design |
| `list_workflows` | List built-in and custom templates |
| `review_workflow` | Sanity-check a planned workflow before execution |
| `design_workflow` | Natural language goal → draft workflow |
| `update_draft` | Edit draft workflow steps |
| `confirm_draft` | Finalize draft → ready to execute |
| `plan_workflow` | Generate execution plan from template, returns workflow_id |
| `create_workflow` | Create custom workflow from step list |
| `run_workflow` | Execute workflow, pauses at approval gates |
| `get_workflow_status` | Query state + diff report + audit log |
| `approve` | Human approval, continue execution |
| `rollback` | Abort and rollback at any stage |
| `cancel_workflow` | Cancel a workflow — move it to the terminal CANCELLED state |

## MCP Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-pilot": {
      "command": "vmware-pilot",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Fallback: `{"command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "vmware-pilot", "vmware-pilot-mcp"]}` still
> works, but `uvx` re-resolves against PyPI on every start and fails behind a TLS-inspecting
> corporate proxy (`invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer`). The installed entry point above
> touches the network zero times; set `UV_NATIVE_TLS=true` if you must use `uvx`.
