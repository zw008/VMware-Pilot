"""MCP server for VMware Pilot — workflow orchestration.

Thin entrypoint. The shared FastMCP instance and helpers live in
``mcp_server._shared``; the 13 tools are defined across ``mcp_server.tools``
(lifecycle / query / authoring) and register themselves on import. The
store/executor singletons + accessors live here because the test-suite patches
``server._store`` / ``server._executor``; ``_shared`` defers to these accessors
so those patches are honoured.

Exposes 13 tools for AI agents to manage multi-step VMware workflows:
  plan_workflow / run_workflow / approve / rollback / cancel_workflow
  review_workflow / get_workflow_status / list_workflows / get_skill_catalog
  create_workflow / design_workflow / update_draft / confirm_draft

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment declaration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: What this skill reports as the environment of everything it touches.
#:
#: Policy rules scope by environment, and the baseline treats a target that
#: declares none as unknown — today that warns on state-changing operations,
#: and the next major release refuses them. Every other skill answers this from
#: its own config, where an operator labels each target ``production`` /
#: ``staging`` / ``lab``.
#:
#: vmware-pilot has no such config and no connection of its own — deliberately.
#: It orchestrates other skills, and its own writes (plan / approve / rollback /
#: cancel / the authoring tools) all land in the local workflow DB
#: (``~/.vmware/workflows.db``), never on a VMware estate. The executor does not
#: call VMware APIs; with no dispatch function configured — which is the case
#: for this MCP server, see ``vmware_pilot.executor`` — executable steps are
#: recorded as ``not_executed`` and the run reports ``dispatch_required``.
#:
#: So the approval gate on the real infrastructure change is not skipped, it
#: happens downstream: the calling agent performs each step through the target
#: skill's own MCP tool, in that skill's process, where that skill's resolver
#: reports the target's declared environment and the gate applies. Requiring
#: pilot to declare an environment it has no basis to know would block workflow
#: authoring permanently while protecting nothing.
#:
#: CAVEAT for embedders: this resolver is process-global in vmware_policy, not
#: per-server. An embedder that constructs ``WorkflowExecutor`` with a real
#: dispatch callable that invokes sibling skills *in this same process* would
#: have those skills' writes resolve to ``local`` instead of the target's real
#: declared environment — silently unscoping exactly the rules this mechanism
#: exists to enforce. Such an embedder must re-register the skill's own resolver
#: around the dispatched call. The shipped stdio server never dispatches, so
#: this cannot arise from normal use.
