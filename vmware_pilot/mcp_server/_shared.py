"""Shared MCP instance + helpers for VMware Pilot tools.

Holds the single FastMCP instance every tool module registers onto and small
helpers (template-name validation, YAML persistence). The store/executor
accessors live in ``vmware_pilot.mcp_server.server`` (the patch target the test-suite uses);
the ``_get_store``/``_get_executor`` wrappers here defer to them at call time so
that ``monkeypatch.setattr(server, "_store", ...)`` is observed.

#: Exception types this package raises on purpose, whose text it authors and
#: therefore trusts to reach the agent verbatim. ``ValueError`` is the whole
#: list because it is the whole vocabulary: the executor's step-reference and
#: redacted-secret refusals, and ``_validate_template_name``'s traversal
#: rejection. Each names what to run next.
#:
#: ``RuntimeError`` is deliberately absent. It is Python's generic catch-all, so
#: allowing it through would pass any driven skill's raw text as if pilot had
#: written it — and pilot dispatches to every other skill in the family, so that
#: text is exactly the untrusted material this wrapper exists to withhold.
#: ``executor._noop_dispatch`` does raise one with an authored message; it is
#: documented as never invoked, and it wants a domain exception of its own
#: rather than a hole here.

    Pilot orchestrates the other skills, so an unplanned exception here can be

    response, a task URL with credentials in its userinfo. Full traceback goes
    to the server log; the agent sees only a control-char-stripped,
    length-capped message.

    This does not touch gate refusals. Every guard in the executor — terminal
    state, missing approver, not-awaiting-approval — *returns* its payload
    rather than raising, so a refusal never reaches this function and cannot be
    reduced to a class name by it.

    500 rather than the family's usual 300: three of the executor's six authored
    refusals are already longer than 300 characters before interpolation, the
    redacted-secret one at 403, and in each the remedy comes last. Capping at
    300 would cut off the instruction and leave the diagnosis.
