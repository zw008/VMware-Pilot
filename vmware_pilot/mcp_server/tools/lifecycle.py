    IMPORTANT — this MCP server has no dispatcher and cannot call other

    run finishes with outcome='dispatch_required' (NOT 'completed'),
    returning each pending step's skill/tool/params. YOU (the calling
    agent) must then perform those skill/tool calls in order. A workflow
    only reaches 'completed' when every step genuinely executed via a
    real dispatcher (embedders supplying one to WorkflowExecutor).

    Safety: the workflow is structurally reviewed before each run. Runs
    are REFUSED if review finds ungated destructive steps or destructive
    steps inside a parallel group, unless force=True (forced runs are
    written to the workflow audit log).

    When an approval gate is reached, the workflow pauses with state
    'awaiting_approval'. Call approve() to continue.
