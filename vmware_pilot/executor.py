"""Workflow executor — runs workflow steps, handles approval gates and rollback.

The executor does NOT call VMware APIs directly. It delegates to skill MCP tools
via a pluggable dispatch interface. This keeps pilot decoupled from any specific skill.

IMPORTANT — dispatch honesty: when no dispatch function is configured (the
default for the MCP server, which has no way to call sibling skills itself),
the executor does NOT pretend to execute steps. Executable steps are recorded
as ``status="not_executed"`` and the run finishes with
``outcome="dispatch_required"`` (state stays ``pending``), listing each pending
step's skill/tool/params so the calling agent can perform them and never with
state ``completed``.
