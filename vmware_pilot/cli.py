"""Typer CLI for vmware-pilot.

Pilot is an orchestration server with no vCenter connection of its own, so this
CLI is deliberately thin: its job is to give MCP clients a launch command that
lives on ``PATH``.

Why this exists rather than ``uvx --from vmware-pilot vmware-pilot-mcp``: ``uvx``
re-resolves the package against PyPI on every start, which fails behind a
corporate TLS-inspecting proxy (``invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer``).
An installed entry point touches the network zero times. See the family
convention — every sibling skill exposes the same ``<skill> mcp`` subcommand.
