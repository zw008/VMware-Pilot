description: >
  Use this skill whenever the user wants to design, execute, or manage complex multi-step VMware workflows with human approval and automatic rollback.
  Pilot is the orchestration brain — it breaks a goal into steps across companion VMware skills (aiops, monitor, nsx, nsx-security, aria, vks, storage, avi), adds approval gates before destructive operations, and rolls back automatically if anything fails.
  Always use vmware-pilot for: "clone and test before applying to production", "VMware incident response with checkpoints", "investigate alert root cause", "VMware rolling restart with health checks", "baseline capture and drift detection", "rolling maintenance with AVI drain", or any VMware workflow needing approval gates or rollback.
  15 built-in templates + custom YAML + AI-designed workflows.
  Do NOT use for single-step work — use vmware-aiops for one VM action, vmware-monitor for read-only queries, vmware-avi for load balancer queries.

compatibility: >
  vmware-policy auto-installed as Python dependency (provides @vmware_tool decorator and audit logging). All workflow operations audited to ~/.vmware/audit.db.
  No direct vCenter/NSX credentials: Pilot is an orchestration layer that delegates to companion skills (aiops, monitor, nsx, etc.) which handle their own auth.
  Approval gates: Workflows pause for human review before destructive steps. Rollback automatically reverses completed steps on failure.
  State persistence: SQLite-backed workflow state survives restarts. No webhooks, no outbound network calls.
  Transitive dependencies: Only vmware-policy (audit/policy). No post-install scripts or background services.

## Common Workflows

### 1. Design a Custom Workflow (Interactive)

```
User: "I need to set up a new app environment with networking and VMs"

AI calls: get_skill_catalog()          → see available tools
AI calls: design_workflow(goal="...")   → create draft
AI calls: update_draft(id, steps=[...]) → fill in steps
User reviews and confirms
AI calls: confirm_draft(id, save_as_template=True)
AI calls: run_workflow(id)             → execute with approval gates
```

### 2. Clone-and-Test (Built-in Template)

```
AI calls: plan_workflow("clone_and_test", {
    target_vm: "db01",
    change_spec: {memory_mb: 32768},
    target: "vcenter-prod"
})
AI calls: run_workflow(workflow_id)
→ Clone → Apply → Monitor → [Approval Gate] → Commit → Cleanup
```

### 3. Batch Operations with Approval

```
AI calls: plan_workflow("plan_and_approve", {
    operations: [
        {action: "power_off", vm_name: "db01"},
        {action: "revert_snapshot", vm_name: "db01", snapshot_name: "baseline"},
        {action: "power_on", vm_name: "db01"}
    ]
})
→ Create Plan → [Approval Gate] → Execute Plan (with auto-rollback on failure)
```

### 4. Rolling Maintenance with AVI Drain

Drain traffic from a pool member via AVI, patch the server, then restore traffic:

```
1. vmware-avi pool disable <pool> <server>     # drain traffic from pool member
2. vmware-avi analytics <vs>                    # verify drain complete (0 active connections)
3. vmware-aiops vm guest-exec <vm> --cmd "apt-get upgrade -y"   # patch the server
4. vmware-avi pool enable <pool> <server>       # restore traffic to pool member
5. vmware-avi pool members <pool>               # verify health status is green
```

### 5. AKO-Aware Application Deployment

Deploy a backend VM, create a K8s namespace, and wire up AKO Ingress to the AVI Controller:

```
1. vmware-aiops deploy ova <image> --name <vm>  # deploy backend VM
2. vmware-vks namespace create <ns>             # create K8s namespace
3. kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml                # create Ingress with AKO annotations
4. vmware-avi ako ingress check <ns>            # validate AKO annotations are correct
5. vmware-avi ako sync status                   # verify VS created on AVI Controller
```

## Dispatch Contract (Important)

**Pilot is a Dispatcher, not an Executor.** It generates plans, tracks state, gates on approvals — it does NOT call companion skills' MCP tools itself. The calling AI agent is responsible for invoking `vmware-aiops::vm_clone` etc. when pilot's `run_workflow` returns a step description.

This is intentional v2-style architecture: pilot's context stays small, state is always on disk, and there are no persistent agent threads. Full contract details: see [`references/integration-patterns.md`](references/integration-patterns.md#the-dispatch-contract).

**`get_skill_catalog` is a curated design aid, not a whitelist.** It surfaces 69 hand-picked building blocks across 8 skills — a deliberate subset of what those skills expose (aiops alone has 49 tools; the catalog lists 18). A step's `skill` field is a free-form string handed to the calling agent, so a workflow may name any companion skill, including ones the catalog does not list — pilot itself (`pilot`) is used that way by built-in templates for approval gates. Use the catalog for inspiration; consult the target skill's own SKILL.md for its full tool surface.

## MCP Tools (13 — 4 read, 9 write/control)

| Category | Tool | Risk | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | `get_skill_catalog` | low | Available skills and tools for design |
| | `list_workflows` | low | Built-in + custom templates |
| **Design** | `design_workflow` | low | Natural language → draft |
| | `update_draft` | medium | Edit draft steps |
| | `confirm_draft` | medium | Finalize draft → ready to execute |
| **Execute** | `plan_workflow` | medium | Create from template |
| | `create_workflow` | medium | One-step custom creation |
| | `review_workflow` | low | Structural sanity check before execution (approved \| needs_revision) |
| | `run_workflow` | medium | Execute next checkpoint (agent dispatches each step) |
| **Control** | `approve` | high | Human approval to continue |
| | `cancel_workflow` | high | Cancel a workflow (approval rejected / unsafe) → terminal CANCELLED, can't be run |
| | `rollback` | high | Reverse completed steps |
| | `get_workflow_status` | low | State + audit log |

## Read-Only Mode

A tool from the table above missing from `list_tools()` means this deployment is in read-only mode: `VMWARE_PILOT_READ_ONLY=true`, or the family-wide `VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true`, withholds write tools at start-up. Pilot has no config file — the env vars are the only switch.

Counter-intuitively, **orchestration is pilot's write surface**. All 9 orchestration tools (`design_workflow`, `update_draft`, `confirm_draft`, `plan_workflow`, `create_workflow`, `run_workflow`, `approve`, `rollback`, `cancel_workflow`) go, leaving the 4 query tools: a read-only pilot can inspect workflows but cannot author, run, approve, roll back or cancel one. That is a deliberate lockdown, not a fault — do not retry, and do not look for another tool or a CLI path to the same change. Name the blocked operation and say an operator must clear the switch and restart the server.

`VMWARE_READ_ONLY=true` with `VMWARE_PILOT_READ_ONLY=false` keeps orchestration here and leaves enforcement to the downstream skills — the per-skill variable wins over the family one. Running with local or small models? See [`references/agent-guardrails.md`](references/agent-guardrails.md).

## Built-in Templates (15)

The five most-used:

| Template | Steps | Approval | Skills Used |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clone_and_test` | 6 | Yes | aiops + monitor |
| `incident_response` | 4 | Yes | monitor + aiops |
| `investigate_alert` | 4 / 8 | Yes | monitor + aria (parallel-group gather + 4-criteria checkpoint, optional `deep_dive`) |
| `plan_and_approve` | 3 | Yes | aiops |
| `compliance_scan` | 3 | No | monitor + aria |

Full list: `clone_and_test`, `incident_response`, `investigate_alert`, `plan_and_approve`, `compliance_scan`, `network_segment_setup`, `vks_cluster_deploy`, `rolling_restart`, `capacity_expansion`, `disaster_recovery`, `patch_deployment`, `storage_expansion`, `baseline_capture`, `baseline_audit`, `baseline_remediate`. See `references/templates.md` for full details.

## Custom Templates

Drop YAML files in `~/.vmware/workflows/` — pilot auto-loads them.

```yaml
# ~/.vmware/workflows/restart_cluster.yaml
name: restart_cluster
description: Rolling restart of database cluster
steps:
  - action: check_health
    skill: monitor
    tool: get_alarms
    params:
      target: "{{target}}"
  - action: stop_replica
    skill: aiops
    tool: vm_power_off
    params:
      vm_name: "{{replica_vm}}"
    rollback_tool: vm_power_on
    rollback_params:
      vm_name: "{{replica_vm}}"
  - action: require_approval
    skill: pilot
    tool: approve
    params:
      message: "Replica stopped. Proceed?"
  - action: restart_primary
    skill: aiops
    tool: vm_power_off
    params:
      vm_name: "{{primary_vm}}"
```

## Usage Mode

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|:-----------:|-----|
| Local/small models (Ollama, Qwen) | **MCP** | Structured JSON I/O for multi-step state |
| Cloud models (Claude, GPT-4o) | **MCP** | Design mode needs structured tool calls |
| CI/CD pipeline orchestration | **MCP** | Programmatic plan/approve/run cycle |
| Quick template listing | **MCP** | Call `list_workflows`; the CLI has no template commands |

> Note: every workflow operation — design, plan, run, approve, rollback — is MCP-only.
> The `vmware-pilot` CLI exists to launch the server and report its version, nothing more.
> Other skills in the family (aiops, monitor, avi, etc.) offer full CLI and MCP modes.

## CLI Quick Reference

The CLI is a launcher, not a second interface to workflows:

```bash
vmware-pilot mcp        # start the MCP server (stdio)
vmware-pilot version    # print installed version
vmware-pilot --help

# Validate a custom workflow YAML before loading
python3 scripts/validate_workflow.py ~/.vmware/workflows/my_workflow.yaml

# List available tools across all skills (design helper)
python3 scripts/list_available_tools.py          # all skills
python3 scripts/list_available_tools.py aiops    # specific skill
python3 scripts/list_available_tools.py --json   # JSON output

# View audit logs (via vmware-policy)
vmware-audit log --last 20
vmware-audit log --status denied
```

> Full CLI reference for companion skills: see `references/cli-reference.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow stuck in "awaiting_approval"
Call `approve(workflow_id)` with the correct workflow ID to continue, or `rollback(workflow_id)` to abort. If the MCP session was lost, reconnect and call `get_workflow_status(workflow_id)` to see the current state -- workflows persist in SQLite and survive restarts.

### "Unknown workflow type" error from plan_workflow
The template name is case-sensitive. Use `list_workflows()` to see all available built-in and custom template names. Custom templates must be valid YAML in `~/.vmware/workflows/`.

### Custom YAML template not appearing
1. Verify the file is in `~/.vmware/workflows/` with a `.yaml` extension
2. Check YAML syntax -- run `python3 scripts/validate_workflow.py <path>` to validate
3. Template names must be unique -- a custom template cannot shadow a built-in name

### Rollback fails on some steps
Not all steps are reversible. Steps without `rollback_tool` defined are skipped during rollback. Pilot uses best-effort rollback: if one rollback step fails, it continues with remaining steps and reports which succeeded and which failed.

### "Workflow cannot be run" state error
A workflow can only be run from `pending` or `running` states. If it is in `draft`, call `confirm_draft()` first. If it is in `completed` or `failed`, create a new workflow -- completed workflows cannot be re-run.

### vmware-policy dependency missing
Pilot requires `vmware-policy` for the `@vmware_tool` decorator and audit logging. It is declared as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` and should install automatically. If missing, run `pip install vmware-policy` or reinstall pilot.

## Setup

No vCenter credentials needed — pilot orchestrates other skills that handle connections.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmware-pilot": {
      "command": "vmware-pilot",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Fallback: `{"command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "vmware-pilot", "vmware-pilot-mcp"]}` also
> works, but `uvx` re-resolves the package against PyPI on every start and fails behind a
> TLS-inspecting corporate proxy (`invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer`). The installed
> entry point above touches the network zero times; set `UV_NATIVE_TLS=true` if you must use `uvx`.

## Audit & Safety

All operations are automatically audited via vmware-policy (`@vmware_tool` decorator):
- Every tool call logged to `~/.vmware/audit.db` (SQLite, framework-agnostic)
- Policy rules enforced via `~/.vmware/rules.yaml` (deny rules, maintenance windows, risk levels)
- Risk classification: each tool tagged as low/medium/high/critical
- Environment scoping: policy rules apply per environment, and skills with a config declare `environment:` per target. Pilot has no targets of its own and reports a constant `local` — its writes go to the local workflow DB, never to a VMware estate. The approval gate on the real change is not skipped: it applies downstream when the agent performs each step through the target skill's own MCP tool, against that skill's declared environment
- View recent operations: `vmware-audit log --last 20`
- View denied operations: `vmware-audit log --status denied`

vmware-policy is automatically installed as a dependency — no manual setup needed.
