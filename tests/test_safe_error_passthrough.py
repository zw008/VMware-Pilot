"""Pilot handed the agent whatever exception text it caught, from any skill.

Every tool here ended its ``except`` with ``{"error": str(e), "hint": ...}``.
For the refusals pilot authors that was correct, and it is why the gap stayed
invisible: those are the only failures anyone exercises. Feed a malformed step
reference and you get back the sentence ``executor.py`` wrote for it, so the
payload always looked right.

What no one fed it was a failure from the other side. Pilot is the orchestrator
— it dispatches into aiops, monitor, storage, vks, nsx, avi. An exception raised
inside a driven skill propagates up through ``run_until_checkpoint`` into these
handlers, and ``str(e)`` put that skill's raw text into the model's context: a
vCenter fault body, a NSX response, a task URL with credentials in its userinfo.
Pilot's own tests never see it because they drive workflows with stub dispatch.

So the rule is the family's: ``ValueError`` — pilot's entire deliberate
vocabulary — passes through, everything else is reduced to its type.

The load-bearing property is that this cannot swallow a gate. Every guard in the
executor (terminal state, missing approver, not-awaiting-approval) *returns* its
payload rather than raising, so a refusal never reaches ``_safe_error`` at all,
and the redaction cannot turn "I refuse, here is why" into a class name. The
tests below pin that directly rather than trusting it to stay true.

``RuntimeError`` is not on the allowlist and must not be added. Pilot drives
every other skill in the family, so a generic catch-all is precisely the channel
by which another skill's raw text would arrive wearing pilot's authorship.
